  title: 'Security by Design: Tested, Proven & Accepted'
  content: "Supported by privacy advocates and tested by security professionals, it's
    the only device we trust. Google Pixel devices are some of the most secure devices
    on the market. However, stock Android includes \"Play Store\" trackers and background
    \"MicroG\" services that exploit your data and destroy your privacy. By combining
    secure hardware with free, open-source and privacy focused software, we can achieve
    the ultimate in data protection and privacy. Without background services tracking
    your every move, you can rest easy knowing your data isn't being used against
    you. \n\nEvery software installation is verified and audited to ensure device
    trust and integrity. With modern features such as secure storage enclave, titan
    chip & a fingerprint sensor, you don't have to sacrifice security for convenience. "

    content: You guys rock! I was a bit intimidated on doing the OS myself. Your prices
      are much better than what I could find online and it arrived well packaged,
      ready-to-go. Decided to go with the 3a XL combo with case/screen protector and
      data plan. I've got some referrals to send your way too.

    content: Fast shipping, discrete packaging and the phone was in perfect condition.
      I feel a lot better that I'm not being tracked and my data isn't being sold.
      The pixels aren't cheap but you get what you pay for. Decided to get the full
      package as I was leaving for a work trip. These guys do not disappoint! Thanks
      again!

    content: As a domestic violence victim and after multiple stalking attempts, we
      deduced my abuser had a backdoor to my old device. DYCT was extremely helpful
      in getting me a device that was fresh & clearly separated from my old accounts.
      Thanks to your team for insuring my personal safety and well being!
